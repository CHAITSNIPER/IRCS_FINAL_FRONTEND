          <h2>Khanvale Water Supply & Shivansai Ambe Toilet Projects</h2>
          <p>
            With malnutrition, disease, and death stalking the rural backyard of the metropolis, Bombay City Red Cross (BCRC) continued to undertake rural social development with a view to reducing the yawning urban-rural divide. On April 20, 2008, the Chairman of BCRC, Mr. A. Bulchandani, accompanied by Mrs. Sheroo Palia, Dr. (Ms.) C.J Batliwalla, Mr. Kishore Udeshi, Mrs. Chandra Ruia, and Ms. Roda Billimoria, inaugurated the Khanvale Drinking Water Supply Scheme.

          <p>
            Khanvale is a tribal village located at a distance of 8 kilometers from Shantivan in Raigarh district. With a population of 256 consisting of 45 families of landless laborers and construction site workers, this village faces an acute water shortage which has adversely affected sanitation and hygiene in the village, leading to outbreaks of scabies among children. Three self-help groups of 39 villagers came forward to take on the responsibility & maintenance needed to construct a bore well, install a tank, and tap connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Collaborating with a grassroots NGO, Kushtarog Nirvan Samiti, who would help in overseeing the implementation of the project, BCRC along with Vasundara Alert Excel financially facilitated the coming on stream of this water supply scheme. A bore well was dug & water tank and six tap connections were given at a cost of Rs. 2.80 lakhs. With the inauguration of the Khanvale Drinking Water Supply Scheme, BCRC has the distinction of having completed and gifted drinking water, which is the elixir of life, to seven villages across Maharashtra.

          <h2>Malnutrition Project</h2>
          <p>
            Based on the findings of the Centre for Development Studies Pune which revealed acute malnutrition problems faced by the tribal population of Maharashtra and believing that to beat poverty hunger must first be defeated, BCRC undertook in July 2007, a one-year mid-day meal program at Katai village in Bhiwandi. The main features of the program included mid-day meal, administration of hemoglobin syrup, iron-rich ladoos, deworming syrup, hair lotion for lice control, and health hygiene sessions. Six months later, there was a noticeable change and the same children appeared more active and full of life, vigor & displayed a sign of confidence. The program has spurred BCRC to continue in the coming 2008-2009 (August to July 2009).
