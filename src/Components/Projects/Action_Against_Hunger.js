          <h2>Basic Education and Development</h2>
          <p>
            Basic education links the children, whether of the cities or the villages. Education is the key to the development not only of children but of nations. Prem Seva Mahila Mandal, as an NGO with its volunteers, has been working to address this issue over the years, across communities by promoting the cause of education by generating awareness, encouraging children to attend schools, initiating innovative school programs like door-to-door schools for children who have never attended school or have dropped out for various reasons through our mobile school bus. This is possible only if every single person in society joins hands and comes together to demand and ensure education. Bombay City Red Cross has given the resources to the cause of education through the nutritious mid-day meal.

Over 40 volunteers have been trained as educators, and counselors for empowering these children and adolescent girls.
